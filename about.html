    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p class="intro">I’m Vibeke Ihlen Selnes, studying Programmering og Systemarkitektur at the University of Oslo. I graduate with a bachelor’s degree in 2026 and I’m currently looking for a summer internship as well as part-time or full-time roles for next year.</p>
    <p class="intro">I’ve worked with Java, C#, Python, HTML/CSS, and tools like Unity, Godot, and Playwright. I’m currently learning JavaScript and React. Outside my studies I build small side projects for fun—if you’re curious, take a look at my <a href="projects.html" class="inline-link">projects page</a> :D</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I come from a varied background in art, political science, mental health, and education. A lifelong passion for video games nudged me into programming, and I’ve fallen in love with it over the recent years. I especially enjoy the teamwork and the feeling of building systems and products with professional polish.
    </p>
    <p>I've always loved working with people no matter what field, and find that I care a lot about team dynamics and good relations.
    My work experience in education has taught me how much better work is when everyone's unique skills come to use.
    </p>

    <h3>How I work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Team oriented: </strong>I believe good communication is the key to a successful project. When everyone on the team feels valued, heard and knows what to do, efficiency and quality follows.</li>
      <li><strong>Learn-by-doing: </strong>I like to prototype small slices, test, and iterate in order to learn new things. I pick up tools quickly and enjoy figuring out things out.</li>
      <li><strong>UX oriented: </strong>Making sure the product actually fits the needs and expectations of the end user is very important to me. Communicating features clearly
      is also essential.</li>
      <li><strong>Calm under pressure: </strong>I find that tight deadlines help me prioritize what is most important, and what's less essential.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Who am I looking for?</h2>
    <p>I am looking for developer jobs and internships in 2026, whether it be full-time, part-time or a summer internship. Although I currently lean more front-end, I would also love to learn more back-end development! 
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy working in teams that value clear communication, mutual respect, and end-user satisfaction. I want to contribute, learn fast, and build things people actually using.
    </p>
