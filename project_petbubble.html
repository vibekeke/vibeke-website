        <p class="lede">
            A game jam game about petting a soap bubble!
        </p>
        <p>This game was made as part of Global Game Jam 2025, over a single weekend. As I was quite busy
         that particular weekend, I decided to keep the scope super minimal and create a game where you simply pet a bubble.
        </p>
        <p>The theme of the gamejam was "bubbles", and the idea came to mind of creating a game about trying to pet something that
            is inherently fragile.
        </p>
        <p>This was the first game I ever completed, exported and published, and it taught me a lot about priotitizing the features
            that are absolutely necessary to create a playable experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        <a class="inline-link" href="https://bekeblob.itch.io/petbubble">The game can be played in browser here at itch.io!</a></p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The game does not give much info to the player regarding the mechanics, aside from how to pet the bubble. It is up to 
        the player to experiment in order to learn how to win and lose the game - or whether such a thing is even possible.
    </p>
    <div class="text-image">
      <img src="assets/projects/petbubble/klappe.gif" alt="Gameplay footage of a bubble being pet">
      <p>The animations and bubble animations react to being pet, as an internal score keeps track
        of the bubbles happiness level.
      </p>
    </div>
        <p>There are two fail states to the game:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Petting the bubble too much</li>
        <li>Petting the bubble too rarely</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A cooldown timer keeps track of the bubbles "stress" level and "loneliness" level, and if either value reaches a certain point it is game over.</p>
    <p>Hoever, if the player manages to pet the bubble just the right amount, they are rewarded with a victory screen and a nice song.</p>

      <p>The face follows the mouse cursor as the bubble waits in anticipation! Meanwhile, you can pop nearby (non-sentient) bubbles.</p>
    </div>
    <p>A lot of work went into making sure the face and bubble animations felt responsive and reactive. The face is also the primary 
        communication tools regarding the state of the bubble. It is up to the player to recognize the changing face and adjust their petting tempo accordingly.

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>This project was great for seeing what I could do with very little time to learn new things. It was also nice to 
        work with a hard deadline, as exporting projects and showing it to people is often a part of the process it is easy to 
        procrastinate.
    </p>
    <p>It was also great working around so many talended people, getting their feedback and seeing how they work. I definitely look forward
        to attending more jams and hackatons in the future!
