          A cute Magical Girl Game Project made in collaboration with Tyler McAllister.
        </p>
        <p>I initially started this project as the 2D artist and animator, but as I've learned how to code on my own
          I am now contributing to the implementation of the game as well. It has been wonderful way to
          learn system design and project management alongside my much more experienced friend.
        </p>
        <p>We are very proud of this game, and are looking forward to continuing development!</p>

        <p>An ongoing team project inspired by terrariums and pet simulators, made in Unity. 
        </p>
          It is still in the early stages, as we wanted to develop robust and scalable systems.
          for our vision. We are very satisfied with out planning efforts and current implementation.
          However, the project is currently on hold due to the university semester start.
        <p>

        <p>This was my first time diving deeply into Unity, and it gave me lots of experience working with c# and Unity alongside
          a highly skilled team!

        <p>A short game jam for the Global GameJam 2025, with the theme "bubbles"</p>
        <p>The game was made entirely by me over a single weekend. My goal for this project was to keep things extra simple so that I could finish it despite the limited timeframe.</p>
        <p>I made a lot of mistakes on this project and learned a lot, and I am quite satisfied with the fact that I was able to finish the game! The game can be played in browser, and although it works on mobile it is intended to be played on desktop.</p>

        <p>A short RPG made for the IFI-Gamejam 2025. The game was made over a single weekend, in a team of 6 students. My main contribution to the game was the scene switching logic, as well as general integration of different game parts.</p>
        <p>We had tons of fun making this game, and we managed to get lots of working systems interacting together! Although
          we had to ship a simpler version than what we planned for, we are very proud of the result.
          Overall, it was a great learning experience in project planning and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>The project can be viewed and downloaded on itch.io, and requires pygame to be run.</p>
